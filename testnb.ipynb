However, their implementation is not shown here because they need more context about what kind of rules you want to extract (e.g., from text segments).\\n- The first clause in the rule mentions a text segment (`text_segment(is_provided)`) to verify if we're working with the right data.\\n- `some_rule` and `some_other_rule` are examples of predicates that could potentially be used to extract rules. In reality, they would depend on what kind of rules you want to extract from your input (e.g., regular expressions for text segment patterns).\\n- The final clauses just assert certain conditions (`provided`, `happy`).\",\n",

extracted rules and their conditions. Each rule is represented as a predicate that checks if the condition is met. The conditions are also represented as predicates that check if certain properties are true.\\n\\nPlease note that this is just one possible way to represent these rules in Prolog. Depending on the specific requirements, other representations may be more suitable.\\n\\nAlso, please note that this representation does not include any additional data structures or queries to verify the rules against external data sources (e.g., government-issued ID verification). It simply represents the rules as predicates.\\n\\nYou can use this representation to query the Prolog engine with different inputs and see if the conditions are met. For example:\\n\\n```prolog\\n?- valid_id_required(25, Customer).\\nCustomer = enabled_status,\\nAge = 25.\\n```\\n\\nThis query checks if a customer is at least 25 years old and has a valid ID. If both conditions are true, it returns `enabled_status` as the age verification status.\\n\\nSimilarly, you can use other queries to check different rules:\\n\\n```prolog\\n?- terms_and_conditions_agreed(Customer).\\nCustomer = enabled_status,\\nTermsAgreed = true.\\n```\\n\\nThis query checks if the customer has agreed to the terms and conditions. If both conditions are true, it returns `true` as the result.\\n\\nYou can also use this representation to verify compliance with certain rules:\\n\\n```prolog\\n?- service_usage_required(Customer).\\nCustomer = enabled_status,\\nTermsAgreed = true,\\nReadUnderstood = true.\\n```\\n\\nThis query checks if the customer has agreed to the terms and conditions, read the agreement, and is compliant with the laws. If all conditions are true, it returns `true` as the result.\\n\\nPlease note that these queries are just examples, and you can use other queries to verify compliance with different rules.\",\n",

The first rule (`transaction/1`) defines what constitutes a transaction by using the auxiliary predicate `amount_of/1`. This hypothetical predicate should check the amount associated with a given transaction.
