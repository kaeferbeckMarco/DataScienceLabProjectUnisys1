However, their implementation is not shown here because they need more context about what kind of rules you want to extract (e.g., from text segments).\\n- The first clause in the rule mentions a text segment (`text_segment(is_provided)`) to verify if we're working with the right data.\\n- `some_rule` and `some_other_rule` are examples of predicates that could potentially be used to extract rules. In reality, they would depend on what kind of rules you want to extract from your input (e.g., regular expressions for text segment patterns).\\n- The final clauses just assert certain conditions (`provided`, `happy`).\",\n",

extracted rules and their conditions. Each rule is represented as a predicate that checks if the condition is met. The conditions are also represented as predicates that check if certain properties are true.\\n\\nPlease note that this is just one possible way to represent these rules in Prolog. Depending on the specific requirements, other representations may be more suitable.\\n\\nAlso, please note that this representation does not include any additional data structures or queries to verify the rules against external data sources (e.g., government-issued ID verification). It simply represents the rules as predicates.\\n\\nYou can use this representation to query the Prolog engine with different inputs and see if the conditions are met. For example:\\n\\n```prolog\\n?- valid_id_required(25, Customer).\\nCustomer = enabled_status,\\nAge = 25.\\n```\\n\\nThis query checks if a customer is at least 25 years old and has a valid ID. If both conditions are true, it returns `enabled_status` as the age verification status.\\n\\nSimilarly, you can use other queries to check different rules:\\n\\n```prolog\\n?- terms_and_conditions_agreed(Customer).\\nCustomer = enabled_status,\\nTermsAgreed = true.\\n```\\n\\nThis query checks if the customer has agreed to the terms and conditions. If both conditions are true, it returns `true` as the result.\\n\\nYou can also use this representation to verify compliance with certain rules:\\n\\n```prolog\\n?- service_usage_required(Customer).\\nCustomer = enabled_status,\\nTermsAgreed = true,\\nReadUnderstood = true.\\n```\\n\\nThis query checks if the customer has agreed to the terms and conditions, read the agreement, and is compliant with the laws. If all conditions are true, it returns `true` as the result.\\n\\nPlease note that these queries are just examples, and you can use other queries to verify compliance with different rules.\",\n",

      "[\"I'm happy to help, but you haven't provided a text segment for me to extract rules from. Please paste the text segment, and I'll be able to assist you with extracting the rules in Prolog format.\", 'Here are the extracted Prolog-style rules in a format that can be used to implement these rules in Prolog:\\n\\n```prolog\\n% Rule 1: Customers must agree to terms and conditions before using the service.\\nagree_to_terms :- \\n    customer_data_present,\\n    agrees_to_conditions,\\n    !.\\n\\nagrees_to_conditions :- \\n    yes. % Replace with actual logic for agreeing to conditions\\n\\ncustomer_data_present :- \\n    true. % Replace with actual logic for presence of customer data\\n```\\n\\n```prolog\\n% Rule 2: All customer data must be encrypted when stored or transmitted.\\nencrypt_customer_data :- \\n    customer_data_present,\\n    encrypts_customer_data,\\n    !.\\n\\nencrypts_customer_data :- \\n    yes. % Replace with actual logic for encryption\\n```\\n\\nNote that the `!` symbol is used to indicate a predicate has no cut, meaning it can be redefined by a more specific rule. This is not strictly necessary in this case but can help ensure that only one rule is applied when two rules are equivalent.\\n\\nAlso note that these rules use the `yes/no` style of Prolog, which assumes a binary decision (e.g., \"is the data present?\", \"has the user agreed to the conditions?\"). In practice, this might need to be adapted for your specific application.', \"Unfortunately, the provided text segment does not contain any Prolog rules. The text appears to be written in natural language and provides general guidelines or requirements, but it is not written in Prolog's formal logic syntax.\\n\\nProlog is a declarative language that uses logical statements (e.g., `parent(john, bob)`) to define relationships between entities. In contrast, the provided text segment presents rules as statements of fact or requirements, rather than using a formal logical syntax.\\n\\nIf you'd like, I can help you rephrase these guidelines in Prolog format, but it would require some interpretation and translation of the natural language into Prolog's logical syntax.\", \"Here are the extracted rules in Prolog format:\\n\\n```prolog\\n:- rule(transaction_management_rule1, above_threshold_transaction, $10,000,\\n        must_be_reported_to_compliance).\\n\\n:- rule(transaction_management_rule2, refund_request,\\n        30,\\n        days_after_purchase_date).\\n```\\n\\nNote that I've assigned a predicate name to each rule (e.g., `above_threshold_transaction`, `refund_request`) and used the `rule/3` predicate in Prolog to define them. The first argument of `rule/3` is the predicate name, the second argument is the head of the rule, and the third argument is the body of the rule.\\n\\nIn a real-world implementation, you would likely want to create separate predicates for each condition (e.g., `above_threshold`, `refund_request`) and define them as facts or rules. The extracted code above is just one possible way to represent these rules in Prolog format.\", 'Here are the extracted rules in Prolog format:\\n\\n```prolog\\n% Rule 6: Employees cannot approve their own expense reports.\\nemployee_approves_expense_report(N, false).\\n\\n% Rule 7: Manager must approve any discount greater than 20%.\\nmanager_approves_discount(M, D, approved(D)) :- manager_isAuthorized(M), D > 20.\\n\\n% Rule 8: Checks for manager authorization\\nisManagerAuthorized(H) :-\\n    % Assuming a rule or data structure to check if H is a manager\\n    manager_of(H).\\n```\\n\\nNote that the `manager_of/1` predicate is assumed to be defined elsewhere, as it is not specified in the provided text. You may need to adjust this according to your specific requirements.\\n\\nAlso note that Prolog rules can be represented using different syntax and notation depending on the implementation and style guide used. This representation follows a common style for declarative logic rules in Prolog.', \"Here are the extracted rules in Prolog format:\\n\\n```prolog\\n% Rule 1: Encrypt customer data when stored or transmitted\\nencrypt_customer_data(Data) :- encrypted(Data).\\n\\nencrypted(Data) :- \\\\+ is_encrypted(Data).\\nis_encrypted(Data) :- is_valid_data(Data), encrypt(Data).\\n\\n% Rule 2: Vendors must be vetted and approved by the procurement team before signing contracts\\nvendored(Vendor) :- vetted_by_procurement(Vendor, ApprovedVendor).\\n\\nvetted_by_procurement(_, Approved). % Add a default clause to avoid errors\\n\\nApproved = _.\\n\\nencrypt(Data) :- is_encrypted(Data), Data2, encrypt_with_secret(Data, Data2).\\n\\nis_valid_data(Data) :- % Add additional validation conditions as needed\\n    true.  % Replace with actual validation logic\\n\\n% Rule 3: Inventory checks must be conducted at the end of each month\\ninventory_check(Year, Month) :- check_month(Years, Year, Months),\\n                              Month =:= 12.\\n\\ncheck_month(_, _, []). % Base case for recursion\\ncheck_month([Year|Years], Year, [Month|Months]) :-\\n    next_month(Years, YearsWithNextMonth),\\n    Months = [Month|_].\\n\\nnext_month([], []).\\nnext_month([Year|Years], [NextYear|YearsWithoutNext]) :-\\n    NextYear is Year + 1,\\n    years_until_year_end(YearsWithoutNext, YearsUntilEnd).\\nyears_until_year_end([], 0).\\nyears_until_year_end([Year|Years], Years) :-\\n    Year < year_end,\\n    Years = [Years - 1|_].\\n\\nyear_end = 12.\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the Prolog code and may need to be adapted based on your specific requirements. Additionally, this implementation assumes certain basic conditions for encryption and validation; in practice, these should be adjusted according to your application's needs.\\n\\nIn general, Prolog rules can be defined as follows:\\n\\n```prolog\\nrule(Assumption) :- [Condition1, Condition2].\\n```\\n\\nWhere `Assumption` is the rule body that will be executed when the conditions are true.\", \"There are no specific rules extracted from the given text segment in Prolog format. The provided text appears to be more of a general statement or introduction, rather than a set of specific rules.\\n\\nHowever, if you'd like, I can help you define some example rules in Prolog format based on the context of compliance, security, and operational efficiency within an organization. Here are a few examples:\\n\\n```prolog\\n% Rule 1: All employees must have a valid username and password.\\nemployee_username(Username, Valid) :-\\n    valid_username(Username, Valid).\\n\\nvalid_username(Username, true).\\nvalid_username(Username, false).\\n\\n% Rule 2: All sensitive data must be stored in a secure location.\\nsecure_data(Location) :-\\n    secure_location(Location).\\n\\nsecure_location('sensitive_data').\\nsecure_location(_).\\n\\n% Rule 3: All employees are required to complete mandatory training sessions annually.\\ntraining_session(Date) :-\\n    annual_training_date(Date).\\n\\nannual_training_date('annual_training_date').\\nannual_training_date(_).\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that these examples are hypothetical and may not reflect the actual rules of a real organization. The provided Prolog code is also simplified for illustration purposes only.\"]\n"
